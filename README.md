# AC-scraper
This project uses Beautiful Soup to scrape data from various websites to populate my Island & Yourland database. The data scraped includes information about DIYs, Art, Items from Saharah, Hybrid Flowers, Bugs, Fish, and Sea Creatures. The data is parsed and formatted to produce SQL queries to easily insert game and user data into a PostgreSQL database.
